    <p>Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.

When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.

Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.

It's ends here.

You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

Gotham's time has come.

This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.

That's a lovely lovely voice!

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.

I am the League of Shadows.

What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?</p>
